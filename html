            Kevelin Miranda is the woman of my dreams, she is the person who i will marry and the first person who i genuinely talk about marriage, she has been there for me throughout every step of the way and just sticks by my side specially when i need her, she's always there to comfort me, and is always there to just love me unconditionally regardless of the mistakes we made with leaving each other, we learned from all of our mistakes, and now we are the strongest couple, our communication is perfect, just like her. Kevin Mancia loves you and only you forever and his love for you will keep on growing until the end of time.
